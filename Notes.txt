Virtual Ant (VA)
	Memory
		Stack
		Size "MAX_SIZE"
		Functions
			Pop
				Get position, remove from stack
			Push
				Pushes a coordinate to memory
			Peek
				Get position, don't remove from stack
			Clear
				Clears stack
			Empty
				Checks to see if stack is empty
			Full
				Checks to see if stack is full
		Can be described as coordinate (x,y)
		NO MEMORY IS DISPLAYED TO VA
	Functions
		MARK - marks it's current position
		MOVE_F - Moves one position forward
		MOVE_B - Moves one position backward
		MOVE_L - Moves one position left
		MOVE_R - Moves one position right
		CWL
			Checks if all positions to the left (until meeting a wall) are marked
			if yes return 0
			if no return 1
		CWR
			Checks if all positions to the Right (until meeting a wall) are marked
			if yes return 0
			if no return 1
		CWF
			Checks if all positions in Front (until meeting a wall) are marked
			if yes return 0
			if no return 1
		CWB
			Checks if all positions to Back (until meeting a wall) are marked
			if yes return 0
			if no return 1
		BJPI
			Goes x lengths in y direction
			x and y are determinded from CWL, CWR, CWF, or CWB
				Whichever is last and returns a response
		CJPI
			same as BJPI except it goes only 1 space instead of x
		BACKTRACK
			go to the last position in memory using Pop
		RP n t
			"repeats the n actions following the RP action for t times"
			unclear what this means

Questions:
	What is "RP n t"
	What is the maze
